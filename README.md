# Loan Comparison

Given predicted rate increases over the next 10 years, find appropriate loan pricing for several different loan types:  fixed, variable, and fixed with a rate reset.  The results will show that the lending bank would be indifferent to whichever loan the customer chooses as total interest income over the life of the loan is equal in all scenarios.
